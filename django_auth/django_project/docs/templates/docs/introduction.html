      <!-- 
          forgive my excessive use of br tag
          i did it because i want to re use
          the styling across the documentation
          and the margins for each p tag might be variable 
          and finally to save space that will have been wasted if 
          i use classes or tags and didnt use them
          accross all documentation pages.

          THANK YOU
       -->

       <!--
         i didnt put the id's at where it would have been because of the fact that the
         navbar is fixed and when i use the links to navigate it works like the navbar 
         is not on the same page but ontop the page and i dont want to use javascript
        i heard something like it putting more pressure on browsers and negatively impacting 
      loading time
      but from the id's name you will know what i want to lead to

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p id="why-anim8">
      Anim8 is an open-source library filled with premade cross-browser CSS
      animations ready to take your project to the next level. Anim8 allows
      users to import or download web animations for faster development in
      normal language.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>WHY "Anim8"?</h3>
    <p>
      With anim8 you simply have the best at your fingertips with just a few
      words added to your class list - perfect for beginners, and those who
      simply want to do simple animations at break record timings. To name a
      few more:
      <ul>
          <li>
          Anim8 can be used as a cross-browser animation library in your online
          projects. Excellent for leading hints, home pages, sliders, and
          emphasis. They are compact files that function on desktops and can be
          resized without losing quality.
          </li>
          <li>
          One of the many methods to utilize Anim8 is to copy and paste the
          effect into your own CSS or to reference the stylesheet. Then, simply
          add the effect's class name to the element you want it to be applied
          to.
          </li>
          <li>It has a very modest file size.</li>
          <li>
          Use your favourite tools without jumping through endless hoops to
          ensure compatibility. Anim8 "just works". We worry about compatibility
          so that you don’t need to. Another headache is solved.
          </li>
          <li>
          Exposes animation elements and parameters to use as targeting elements
          to add interactivity and manipulate at run-time.
          </li>

    <h3>HOW THIS DOCUMENTATION IS ARRANGED</h3>
    <!-- 
      guys i noticed stuff i dont need those codes for < >
      in a p tag i just put it like that.

      If you are new to this and want to get up and running in say 10min or so
      check the <a href="{% url 'docs:tut' %}">Tutorials</a>. 
      If you are interested in finding more information,
      especially about the animations we provide, our technical reference
      serves your purpose. If you feel the defaults aren’t your style and you
      want to change them do check the how-to guides. Lastly, if you’re
      curious and want to know how it all works the nuts and bolts and
      everything in between do check <a href="{% url 'docs:works' %}">How it all works</a>.
      <strong id="the-anim8-case">! Important</strong> - In all
      code snippets shown anything you see in between <...> is variable, just
      so you know. And now another important thing…
    </p><br>
    <h3>THE ANIM8 CASE</h3>
    <p>
      Since our purpose is to better the developer's life we have considered a case,
       how do we know which class belongs to which library
      (eg. bootstrap) assuming you want to use some other library so we use a special case 
      " _className".
    </p><br><br>
    <p>
      Now to the meat...
